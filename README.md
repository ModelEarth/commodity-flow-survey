# Commodity Flow Survey - By Zip

[Foodflows.org by County](https://foodflows.org/)  

[The FoodFlow Paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac5270) uses [5-year datasets](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9585947) and references [Lin's 2019 paper](http://mkonar.cee.illinois.edu/36_Lin_ERL_2019.pdf), which uses the the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS).

The Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) survey includes zip codes.  

In this repo, we'll be parsing the zip codes into a json and .md file for each zip.  

Similar parsing occurs in our [zip usa repo io folder](https://github.com/modelearth/zip/tree/master/io).
